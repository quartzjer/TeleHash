no pings! always send .see of ones near a writer and .to of id near you (who they would have to .see back from)
anytime any packet comes in check to see if we want to bucket the sender (if they're close to us), if so open a line to them
always just ignore telexes if to throttle back

"open line"
	dial yourself via the recipient
	they'll respond with a .see (and _line)
		unless they're the closest to you, then they /should/ open a line back to place in their own bucket
	if they have an open line to you, you're the closest to yourself, they'll .see yourself to you

client model thoughts
	three layers
		wire
			json, line validation, timeouts
			calls out to any processing filters
		filters
			checks all telexes to match filters to callbacks
		bucket
			responds to any end
			self seeding and maintenance of buckets
		hist
			.hist command, keeps cache of history
		forwards
			.fwd command, sets up filters and relays
		app interface
			send telexes
			register related filters for answers/timeouts
	telex_send(..., callback, expiration)
		if no response from other writer by expiration then callback will fire too
		depending on the type of telex, wire layer will build a filter to catch responses
			.end looks for *any* .see's until expire
			.fwd looks for *any* matching signals until (optional) .fwds is empty or expire
			.hist looks for *any* matching signals until expire
	line events
		register to receive any line creation, coming expiration, or deletion event
		
common utility patterns
	centralized signing (rsa?) for announcing self to trusted peers
		configured shared authority, probably app-defined or selectable
		custom protocol to authority to authenticate app on initialization (http or th)
		have announcement signal signed by authority
		dial the hash(es) that peers would be listening on sending your identifying signal and it's sig
			"itsme"="1.2.3.4:5678"
			"itsme-sig"="60AD5A78..."
	self-signed (trust is discovered and then remembered, like ssh/otr)
		sign announcements
		custom protocol to return your public key on demand
		when an announcement happens from someone new, ask them for the pubkey and check to see if they're known/validated

dogfooding
	chat/list, called "what"
		use simple rsa, openssl?
		gen or use config'd private key
		have a dedicated thapp that takes a signed what announcement (name+url+ipp), signs it back
			manually approve any new sigs first time, then auto-sign
		"what" client announces using that sig and their own sig so they are whitelisted
		any messages are normal signals signed by each client

data structure thoughts
	two root lists
		writers
			hashtable by cb as the key
			each one contains details about a writer and it's last known state
		hashes
			hashtable by sha1 hash as the key
			contains what we know about this hash
				popularity
				signal stats
				recent telexes
				any fwds we have for it
	secondary indexes
		buckets
			binary distance from self (159 of them)
			each contains a list of writers by cb
	active
		any writer we've gotten a packet from in the last X minutes
		used only for finding closer writers to recommend
		158 buckets, a fixed array
			each entry is also an array of writers
	writer
		ip:port/hash
		last sent
		fail (incremented by eviction/nat loops)
		last seen (always set fail=0 when updated)
		first seen
		line/pin
		possibly nat'd, only set when a .nat was what created the writer (first telex)
		referrer (so we can .nat them if needed)
		fwd state
	nat'd
		every X min (5?) walk array
		if last seen > 5, dial self via them (so they .see us back)
	forwards
		array of writers that we have active forwards for
		every X min, refresh
		if any become stale, re-dial for closer

selection
	get bucket (distance from self)
	sort by distance from .to
	select last seen <5min
	select first seen oldest
	and/or with a _line?

eviction
	if more than X in bucket
	send a .to=self empty telex if last seen > X, increment fail 
	any last sent - last seen > X and fail > Y
	any missing _pin (never got packets back)
	finally, youngest (but older than 60s or so, might be mid-dial?)
