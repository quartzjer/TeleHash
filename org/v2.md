telehash v2 (draft)
===================

## Intro

The first version was a minimal layer to do just the DHT/NAT and tried to be very generic and extensible, deferring identity and transport to the app.  This second version drastically simplifies the base protocol and incorporates the identity and transport elements into the core.

## Vocab

* DHT - Distributed Hash Table
* NAT - A device/router that acts as a bridge to internal IPPs (Network Address Translation)

* Hashname - The sha1(public key) of a RSA keypair that belongs to and is signed by a Space, the unique ID of an individual application/instance using telehash
* HIPP - hashname+IP+port, "a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d,123.45.67.89,10111" (v4 or v6), the transient where all UDP network traffic is sent to/from
* Packet - A UDP packet less than 1400 bytes sent between any hashnames
* Switch - The name of the software layer or service parsing packets and listening to an IPP

* Space - A collection of signed hashnames that can trust each other, often supporting a DHT
* Spacer - The protocol every hashname within a Space uses to manage it's DHT
* Operator - An IPP+hashname that uses the 'op' protocol to introduce/describe a Space to any other hashname
* Line - The protocol any two hashnames use to exchange their identity and trust and form a temporary session between two IPPs


## Parsing

Every packet must begin with two bytes that are a short unsigned integer representing the length of bytes that follow it.  That length of bytes are UTF8 encoded JSON and can be parsed by any JSON parser.  Any remaining bytes on the packet are considered raw binary and referenced as the 'body' during content transport.

    [LENGTH][JSON][BODY]

## JSON

The JSON included in any packet is arbitrary, any hashname must have some prior knowledge of what is acceptable to send to any IPP.  There are many common patterns to serve different functions that any two hashnames 'speak' to each other defined here, but beyond these definitions an application can implement it's own patterns as needed, and all switches should ignore anything they don't understand.

The most fundamental pattern is called 'line' and it's how any two hashnames can exchange identity and create a session. When an app is starting it will typically begin by speaking op to one or more operators, the seed list of which is well defined and stable for any space.  From there the operator will return other hashnames and what they speak as is appropriate for that space.  To use the DHT any hashname must also speak spacer, and to exchange arbitrary content any hashname mush speak streamer.

### Line

Line helps establish a relationship between any two hashnames and their current IPPs.  The first packet requires the following top level fields:

* `open` - the RSA signature (by the sending hashname) of the included BODY
* BODY - the attached body is also a JSON object containing:
** `to` - the hashname of the operator the request is going to
** `from` - the sending hashname
** `x` - an integer of the expiration time of this request (epoch milliseconds)
** `key` the signature of the public key for the hashname combined with the included `x` value (key+x signing format TBD).
** `space` the name of the space the sending hashname is part of

Upon receiving, any hashname can check the incoming `from` in the body and see if it already knows the public key for it, if it does it can verify the signature and return a corresponding packet to confirm the line.  All subsequent packets should include only a `line` key (value being the same as the `open`) in each direction as the secret for the receiving switch to identify it.  Only the `open` value is used to initiate a new line at any time.

When a receiving hashname doesn't know the public key for the sender it must ask an operator in the appropriate space for it first.  Public keys for hashnames should be cached as much as possible so that operator lookups aren't often required.


### Spacer

Any space can support a DHT if enough of it's hashnames are connected to each other using spacer.  Speaking spacer has only two simple patterns to support it, finding other hashnames and working around NATs, the bulk of the complexity is in the rules around maintaining a mesh of lines and calculating distance (to be defined again here based on v1).

The DHT can be used for any hash value, to find other hashnames directly or at an app level around arbitrary content.  Each space and app may do this differently, but the basic rules around discovery are the same.

When one hashname wants to lookup a hash, it finds the closest lines it knows and sends a `seek` containing the hash value to them.  They return a compact `see` array of addresses that are closer to the hash value than they are, if any (no response if none).  The addresses are a compound comma-delimited string containing the "hash,ip,port" (these are intentionally not JSON as the verbosity is not helpful here), for example "a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d,123.45.67.89,10111" and the IP can be v4 or v6 (there can be multiple entries in the array for one hashname).

Since the sender doesn't know these addresses and may not need to establish a line with them since it's a transient request, it must also send the hashname that referred them as a lightweight way to vouch for the request as a `via`.  Any incoming `seek` with a `via` should be validated that the receiving hashname has a line open to the one in the via to deter network scanners.

#### "pop" (NATs)

When any hashname is told about a new one (in the `see`), there may be a NAT between them so they must both be told to send a packet to each other to make sure the path between them is open, this is called "hole punching." The `pop` value is used to do this and contains the address being contacted for the first time, and since often the recipient hashname doesn't know (or need to know) the sender, a `for` must be included with it as well containing the address value (hash,ip,port) of the requestor.

The local hashname is A, the existing one in the DHT is B, and this happens when B tells A about C's address.  When A goes to contact C it should send the packet directly, as well as send a packet containing a `pop`:"hashname,ip,port" to B.  Upon receiving a `pop` with a value that is not itself and verified that it is to a line it has open, it sends a new packet with a `pop` and the same value to the given line, as well as relaying the original `for` value (the IP must be validated as the same as the sender). When C receives a `pop` value of itself, it sends a packet with `popped`:true to the value of the `for`.  If the first packet A receives from C is `popped`:true, it should resend the original packet since it was likely dropped due to the NAT, but the path is open now.

### Streamer

A line establishes a lossy connection between hashnames, streamer adds a lightweight stream representation to order, buffer, and retransmit packets.

Any hashname can open a stream simply by sending a `stream` with an arbitrary string value that is the same on all subsequent packets for that stream and returned in all responses by the receiver. All streams have a `seq` integer value that starts at 0 and increments per packet sent.

A buffer of sent packets must be kept keyed by the `seq` value until the receiving hashname has responded confirming them in a `range` and not in the `miss`. The `range` is an array of two integers, the first seq confirmed received in the session as well as the last one received. The `miss` is an array of integers and must be sent along with any `range` if in the process of receiving packets there were any missing sequences, containing in any order the missing sequence values within the associated `range`.  Upon receipt those missed packets should be resent verbatim.

When a stream is open and the responding hashname has sent a range with confirmed sequences, and also gets a confirmation of the packet containing that range, it can advance the first number in the range (they've all been confirmed) so that for an idle stream it doesn't need to preserve any state at all.

By default a session should be invalidated if a sequence has been missed three or more times, or there's more than 100 missed packets by default (senders cannot send more than that without a confirming range). When there's consistently missing packets, senders should limit the number of packets beyond the confirmed range. (TBD)

The JSON and/or BODY can be used arbitrarily within a stream by an app, multiple streams may exist between two hashnames and their state should be preserved as long as the line is open.

### "req" and "res" (CONTENT TRANSPORT)

Any HTTP request can be performed within a session using the `req` and `res` objects.  A `stream` is required and must be unique to each request.  

The `req` is an object that looks like:

    "req": {
	    "uri":"http://telehash.org/"
	    "m":"GET",
	    "h":{ "User-Agent": "testing" }
	}

It can also be a POST or PUT, and any content body on the request should be included as binary appended to the packet, and spread across subsequent packets containing only just the same `tid` value if it's larger than a single one.  When all the data has been sent, a `done` of true must be set on the last packet (or first one if it was all self contained).

Any response works identically, a `res` object like:

    "res": {
        "s":200,
        "h":{ "Content-Type": "foo", "Content-Length":100 }
    }

The binary body is appended to the packet, and when broken across multiple they must all contain just the same `tid` and the body is appended in order based on the `seq` until the last one containing the `done` of true.

The URI in the request doesn't need to be just HTTP either, this pattern can be used for streaming or other content transport patterns, and application specific schemes.

## Hashname state

At any point the relationship between two hashnames would be in one of the following states:

* UNKNOWN - no contact
* SEEKING - one hashname is looking for another on the DHT
* CONNECTING - was given an IPP for a hashname and sent it a sig
* CONNECTED - both sent and received a sig
* VALIDATING - requesting the profile of a hashname to get the public key to verify the sig value
* VALIDATED - the sig and voucher check out
* TRUSTED - the hashname or voucher are known and trusted
