telehash v2 (draft)
===================

# Introduction

(note: this is the second major version of the telehash protocol, the first one is deprecated and was a minimal experimental spec to create a distributed hash table, it is very much a work in progress yet and unstable!)

Telehash is a protocol enabling applications to find, identify, and communicate directly with each other.  It is built on public-key security (PKI) and includes the ability to create peer-to-peer (P2P) connections as well as form a distributed hash-table (DHT) for decentralized architectures.  As a protocol it doesn't provide direct end-user functionality (you won't find "client apps" here) but is primarily a tool for developers (specs and libraries/SDKs) to use in creating modern apps that require rich experiences and interconnectivity at scale.

The principle idea that drove the creation and development of telehash is the belief that any app should be able to easily and freely talk to any other app (either two instances of the same app or between completely different apps) directly and in any environment (servers, mobile, sensors, etc).  By enabling this freedom for developers as a foundation for their apps it then enables the same freedom for the people using them, that they can connect, share, and communicate more easily.

The challenges and complexity right now in connecting apps via existing technologies such as APIs, OAuth, and REST is only increasing, often forcing centralized and closed/gated communication platforms.  By adopting telehash in any app it immediately has a powerful set of open tools for not only its own needs, but can then also enable connectivity to and from apps created by others easily. These tools include the ability to have friends, sharing, feeds, tagging, search, notifications, discovery, and other social patterns.

The foundation of the protocol builds on JSON as the core extensible data format with a requirement to keep it simple and lightweight enough to support apps running on networked devices and sensors. The design goals include not forcing any particular architecture design such as client-server, centralized/federated/distributed, polling/push, REST, streaming, publish-subscribe, or message passing... any can be used as telehash simply facilitates creating the bi-directional connectivity between any two or more apps.

There's some high level concepts that are important to understand when talking about anything using telehash, and the first one is that of a "network", the term describing how all telehash apps are organized.  A network is identified by it's hostname (such as "telehash.org" is one network) and is the primary form of trust and authority between apps.  Each network has one or more "operators" which facilitate access to the resources and identities within their network.

Every instance of an app has a unique public id on each network it's connected to that is called it's "hashname" and is the primary means of finding and communicating with other instances in the network. Any app may have one or more networks that it's connected to, including private ones for app-specific services and public ones that are providing functionality to many apps.

# Getting Started

In order to use telehash in an app it will need to include a switch (below, the software layer that speaks the protocol), generate an RSA key-pair (every unique instance of an app has it's own and it's used to create it's hashname(s)), and connect to a network (can start with "telehash.org").  Once it's connected it can find and access other hashnames as well as provide services to back out to anyone on that network.  

Most apps will need their own network for access to their back-end, user management, profiles, notifications, etc facilities. To create a new network you simply need to add a DNS SRV record to the hostname for your network that identifies one or more hashnames of operators that manage it.  (todo show example operators, software and patterns)

## Telehash Switches

The software implementations of the telehash protocol are called a "switch" and it's highly suggested to use an existing switch library or service for your platform or language versus trying to create one from scratch in order to ensure that the security and identity aspects are verified properly. If there isn't one yet then we'd love your help, pull requests to list them here are welcome!

# Protocol Details

## Vocab

* DHT - Distributed Hash Table
* NAT - A device/router that acts as a bridge to internal IPPs (Network Address Translation)
* Hashname - The SHA1(public key + network) of an RSA keypair that is part of a network, the unique ID of an individual application/instance using telehash
* Packet - A UDP packet less than 1400 bytes sent between any hashnames
* Switch - The name of the software layer or service parsing packets for one or more hashnames
* Network - A regular hostname representing a collection of hashnames that have some trust or shared resources
* Operator - A special hashname that acts as a coordinator to introduce/describe a network to any other hashname
* Link - A portable permission from one hashname to another of a shared resource or identity, a signed voucher
* Line - When any two hashnames connect and exchange their identity to form a temporary encrypted session

## Parsing

Every packet must begin with two bytes that are a short unsigned integer representing the length of bytes that follow it.  That length of bytes are UTF8 encoded JSON and can be parsed by any JSON parser.  The JSON is required so the length must be greater than two (the minimum JSON "{}" string) and less than the length of the raw UDP message minus two (the bytes for the short unsigned integer). Any remaining bytes on the packet are considered raw binary and referenced as the 'BODY' when used.

    <length><JSON>[BODY]

Example decoding logic in node (simplified):
``` js
dgram.createSocket("udp4", function(msg){
	var length = msg.readUInt16BE(0);
    var js = JSON.parse(msg.toString("utf8", 2, length + 2));
	var body = msg.slice(length + 2);
});
```

It is a very common pattern for multiple packets to be included in one UDP message, where the BODY is actually another packet, so switch implementations must be prepared to decode a packet generically on demand from a set of raw bytes.

## JSON

The JSON included in any packet is where the keys are to tell a switch how to process it based on the behaviors defined below.  It is intended to be open for growing and evolving outside of the keys defined here, but any experimental or app-specific usage must always name their fields prefixed with an _ so as to not cause conflicts, analogous to the HTTP "X-Header" pattern.

The fields used/expected will often change depending on pre-existing context (is the packet signed, is the sender trusted, etc) or based on other fields being present (is a line or a stream included).

## BODY

The optional BODY is always a raw binary of the remainder bytes between the packet's total length and that of the JSON as indicated by LENGTH above. Often a BODY is another full raw packet and will be decoded identically to being read from the network, this pattern of one packet enclosing/attaching another is how the RSA signatures and encryption are implemented.

The BODY is also used as the raw content transport for streams and for any app-specific usage.

## Packet Processing

When a packet is being processed from a UDP message initially, it's JSON must contain only one of the following two fields that signal how to process the BODY:

* [sig](#sig) - the signature of the packet's BODY to verify the packet it contains
* [line](#line) - the pre-negotiated secret between two hashnames used to decrypt the packet's BODY and process the packet it contains

Once either of these methods have been used to decode the contained BODY, the sender's identity will have been verified along with a new packet to process. With a verified sender, the packet's JSON must contain only one of the following fields that signal the different processing behaviors for the switch:

* [open](#open) - request to establish a line, create a session between two hashnames
* [nat](#nat) - when present, indicates this packet contains a request to work around a NAT
* [stream](#stream) - the JSON and BODY of this packet are part of a stream

When a decoded packet is being verified by a signature at any point, it MUST also contain the following three fields (not required for encrypted `line` packets as the to/from is implicit in the line):

* `to` - the hashname of the recipient
* `from` - the sending hashname
* `x` - an integer timestamp (in epoch milliseconds) of the expiration time of this packet


### Networks

A network is simply a collection of RSA public keys that have some trust each other (typically a single application domain or service) and is identified simply by a valid hostname.  Every public key within a network is identified by it's hashname, which is the SHA1 of it's public key + network name (simple string append of SHA1(pubkey+network)).

Every network is administrated by "operators" who provide network-level services and authority to any hashname, and this list of operators is either dynamically resolved via DNS SRV records or simply bundled privately within an app (seed list).  To resolve a list of operators the names returned from a SRV query on _telehash._udp.network.tld must be in the format hashname.host.tld and each individually resolve to their own IP address, so that the switch has the three required parts to connect to an operator, it's hashname, IP, and port.

Operators perform other key administrative duties such as bootstrapping new hashnames to the DHT (if any) and creating [links](#links) that can be independently used by hashnames within their network.

<a name="sig" />
### `sig` - Signed Packets

Any packet sent between two hashnames can be signed, this is very important for the initial packets so that they can include some assertion of their validity.

To sign any packet, take it's binary serialized output (as if it was going to be written to the network) and perform an RSA HMAC-MD5 signature on it.  Use that original packet as the BODY for a new packet, and include the base64 of the signature as the value to the `sig` in the JSON.

The recipient may or may not know the public key for the sending hashname yet to validate the incoming signature and it may have to ask an operator for the key first before it can process the BODY as a new (verified) packet.

<a name="open" />
### `open` - Establishing a Line

The `open` key is used to establish an active session with a shared secret between any two hashnames and their current IPPs, this is called a line.  The value is a base64-encoded encrypted string, created by the sender using the recipients RSA public key to encrypt a random SHA1 value (the secret) with PKCS1 padding.  The whole packet must also be signed by the sender and verified before being processed by the recipient.

Upon receiving, any hashname can check the incoming `from` and see if it already knows the public key for it, if it does it can verify the signature, decode the `open` value using their own private key, and return a corresponding packet containing it's own encrypted secret `open` to confirm the line.  

<a name="line" />
#### `line` - Packet Encryption

Once either side has both sent an open and received one, it creates a shared `line` value by combining the two secrets concatenated in sorted order, SHA1([sender.openSecret, recipient.openSecret].sort().join("")).  All subsequent packets can then be optionally encrypted since each side has sent the other a secret, and those encrypted packets are identified by including the `line` key with the calculated combined value.

A packet with a verified `line` value has a BODY that is the fully encrypted original packet.  The receiver then decrypts the BODY and processes it as a normal packet (LENGTH/JSON/BODY) from the sending hashname.  All encryption/decryption uses "AES-128-CBC" and the secret of the recipient, with the BODY being the binary encoded result.

<a name="nat" />
### `nat` - Working around NATs 

When any hashname is told about a new one (in the `see`), there may be a NAT between them so they must both be told to send a packet to each other to make sure the path between them is open, this is called "hole punching." The `pop` value is used to do this and contains the target hashname being contacted for the first time.

The recipient of the `pop` must then send a `popping` with the value being the address (hash,ip,port) of the `pop` sender, and send this to the hashname identified in the value of the `pop` that is has a line open to.

The `popping` recipient then sends an ad-hock packet with a `popped` of true to the address given in the `popping` value (along with a `ref` value of the hashname the `popping` came from to validate) if it hasn't seen any packets from that hashname yet (it's own NAT may have dropped them).  This should then create the proper routes between any two NATs for the two to talk.

When the original hashname receives a `popped` it should validate it and then resend the original packet it was trying to send to the target hashname since the path should be open now and the original was likely dropped.

<a name="stream" />
### `stream` - Ordering and Retransmission

(TODO: explain link-scope streams, and chat/feed stream types)

All packets are by their very nature lossy, so `stream` adds a lightweight mechanism to preserve order, add buffering/backpressure, and retransmit dropped packets.  When a stream is first opened, it must include a `type` with a known value so that the receiver can decide how to process/handle the data for that stream (types listed below). Multiple streams will exist between two hashnames as they all define their own scope.

Any hashname can open a stream simply by sending a `stream` key with a unique 40 length hex value (SHA1) that is the same on all subsequent packets for that stream and returned in all responses by the receiver. All streams have a `seq` integer value that starts at 0 and increments per packet sent. Since streams are often used to support data exchange that is larger than one packet, the initial stream creation request isn't considered complete unless or until a packet contains an `fin` key with a true value.  If this includes multiple packets, all are used when processing the initial stream creation request based on the `type` value.

At any point a stream can be closed by sending an `end` with the value of true, and if it was an error a string message can be included as the value of the `err` key.

A buffer of sent packets must be kept keyed by the `seq` value until the receiving hashname has responded confirming them in a `ack` and not in the `miss`. The `ack` is the highest known `seq` value received. The `miss` is an array of integers and must be sent along with any `ack` if in the process of receiving packets there were any missing sequences, containing in any order the missing sequence values up to the `ack`.  Upon receipt those missed packets should be resent verbatim.

By default a stream should be invalidated if a sequence has been missed three or more times, or there's more than 100 missed packets by default (senders cannot send more than that without a confirming range). When there's consistently missing packets, senders should limit the number of packets beyond the confirmed range. (needs more examples/definition)

The `type` value of a new stream can be of the following (or use the "_custom" pattern for app-specific uses):

* [key](#key) - request to return the public key of the `hash`, the answer's BODY is the public key.
* [link](#links) - request for the value of the given link, answer contains `sig` and BODY is the link value
* [seek](#seek) - return any pointers to other closer hashnames for the given `hash` (DHT), answer contains `see` and optionally `routes`
* [route](#route) - request to create a new route, must contain a `link` for that route (can be attached with `sig` and BODY)
* [create](#create) - new link request, must contain details as required for the type of link, answer will be the same as a link q if successful
* [sock](#sock) - raw socket proxy

<a name="key" />
### `key` - Key Lookups

A `key` is a request to return the public key for the hashname included in it's value.

Every hashname must be able to respond to a `key` request for at least itself and optionally for any others it knows, but operators are expected to return them for any valid hashname in their network.

After verifying the request, the recipient returns the public key by sending a BODY that contains the actual public key value, and if it's too large for one packet it can be broken into multiple, with the final one including a `fin` of true.

<a name="seek" />
### `seek` - Finding Hashnames (DHT)

Any network can support a DHT if enough of it's hashnames are connected to each other and respond to `seek` requests properly.  The bulk of the complexity is in the rules around maintaining a mesh of lines and calculating distance (to be defined again here based on v1).

The `seek` value is always a 40 character hex (a SHA1 of anything), it can be used to find other hashnames directly or by an app to find one or more hashnames for any arbitrary content.  Each network and app may use this differently, but the basic rules around discovery are the same.

When one hashname wants to lookup a hash, it finds the closest lines it knows and sends a `seek` containing the hash value to them.  They return a compact `see` array of addresses that are closest to the hash value.  The addresses are a compound comma-delimited string containing the "hash,ip,port" (these are intentionally not JSON as the verbosity is not helpful here), for example "a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d,123.45.67.89,10111" and the IP can be v4 or v6 (there can be multiple entries in the array for one hashname). 

<a name="sock" />
### `sock` - Socket Proxy

A stream can be requested to become a simple raw TCP socket proxy by sending a `sock` key with a value of any "IP:PORT", the receiving hashname should carefully decide if it wants to support this and the destination IP to prevent accidental abuse.  If the socket couldn't open or is closed at any point by either side an `end` of true is sent and any informative `err` string value can be included.

As soon as a `sock` is sent it is considered open by the sender until it receives an `end` telling it otherwise, the stream will inherently only send so much data without any confirmation from the recipient that it's open/reading.


<a name="links" />
### Links

One of the principles of telehash is to operate as distributed and decentralized as possible, and a core part of enabling that is having default methods for allowing apps to perform actions independently without requiring an online centralized resource to verify their permissions to do so.  For example, an app should be able to assert a user's identity to another app such that the receiving app can verify the user from the request alone and not be required to ask a central authority.

A link is the name for a special portable packet that any hashname can use and share within a network.  It is identified by the SHA1(signature) of the full packet, and that hash value is used as the id for the link that is referenced in many other places.

Links act as a temporary binding (they all are required to have an `x` expiration and can be short or long-lived) from one hashname to another of some level of trust around a shared resource or identity.  All links also require a `type` field with a value of one of the following (custom app-defined ones use the "_name" pattern):

* network - the `to` is trusted to be part of this network by the `from`
* app - the `to` is running software written by the `from`
* route - the `to` can request [routes](routes) as identified by this link from other hashnames in this network
* user - the `to` is acting on behalf of a user of this network as identified within this link
* friend - the `to` has verified they are acting on behalf of a friend that is trusted by a user

(TODO: broken-out examples of how to create and use these links, and how they are chained together)

<a name="routes" />
### Routes

The default built-in DHT of telehash enables any app to find and connect with any other app in a network based on it's hashname, but nearly every app has a need to search and connect to others dynamically based on other identifiers (such as user ids, groups/topics, etc).  This alternative search and discovery is called routing and uses a simple mechanism to register and return dynamic routes.

(TODO: example)

### App-Specific Usage

Apps are encouraged experiment/adapt and use their own custom JSON and BODY values outside of this definition but must prefix all custom JSON fields with an underscore ({"_foo":"bar"}) so as to not cause future conflicts.  All switches should process all of the defined values and if any packet has additional data that it hasn't processed it should give any app the opportunity to handle that data with whatever context the switch has about the packet/sender already (was it signed, in a line, stream, etc) to make it easy to grow and customize the protocol.
