Telehash v2 draft
=================

# Introduction

> Note: This is the second major version of the Telehash protocol, the
> first one is deprecated and was a minimal experimental spec 
> to create a distributed hash table, it is a work in progress yet
> and unstable!

Telehash is a new encrypted mesh protocol enabling applications to
find, identify, and communicate directly with each other.  It is built
on public-key security (PKI) and fundamentally creates peer-to-peer
(P2P) connections using a distributed hash-table (DHT) to form the
mesh.

As a protocol, it does not provide direct end-user functionality or
application specifications. Instead, Telehash is primarily a tool for
developers of specifications and of libraries/SDKs to use in creating
modern applications which require rich experiences and private
interconnectivity at scale.

The principle idea that drove the creation and development of Telehash
is the belief that any application instance should be able to easily and
securely talk to any other application instance, wheter they are two
instances of the same application, or completely different
applications. They should be able to do so directly, and in any
environment, from servers to mobile devices down to embedded systems
and sensors.

By enabling this freedom for developers as a foundation for their
applications, Telehash enables the same freedom for the people using
them - that the user can connect, share, and communicate more easily
and with control of their privacy.

The challenges and complexity today in connecting applications via
existing technologies such as APIs, OAuth, and REST is only increasing,
often forcing fundamentally insecure, centralized, and closed/gated
communication platforms.  By adopting Telehash in any application, that
application immediately has a powerful set of open tools for not only
its own needs, but can then also enable connectivity to and from
applications created by others easily. These tools include the ability
to have friends, sharing, feeds, tagging, search, notifications,
discovery, and other social patterns.

Telehash has a fundamental requirement to remain simple and
light-weight in order to support applications running on networked
devices and sensors. The design goals also include not forcing any
particular architectural design such as client-server,
centralized/federated/distributed, polling/push, REST, streaming,
publish-subscribe, or message passing... any can be used, as Telehash
simply facilitates secure connectivity between any two or more
applications.

# Protocol Details

## Glossary

  * **DHT**: Distributed Hash Table (based on
    [Kademlia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia))
  * **NAT**: A device/router that acts as a bridge to internal IPPs
    (Network Address Translation)
  * **Hashname**: The unique ID of an individual application/instance
    using Telehash
  * **Packet**: A UDP packet less than 1400 bytes sent between any
    hashnames
  * **Switch**: The name of the software layer or service parsing
    packets for one or more hashnames
  * **Line**: When any two hashnames connect and exchange their identity
    to form a temporary encrypted session (like a VPN tunnel between
    them)
  * **Streams**: Dynamic bi-directional channels that can transfer
    reliable/ordered content within any line

## Telehash Switches

In order to use Telehash in an application, the application will need
to include a software layer that talks to the Internet and processes
Telehash packets, known as a "switch".

It is highly recommended to use an existing switch library or service
for your environment, rather than creating one from scratch. This will
help insure that the security, identity, and networking aspects are
verified properly. If there isn't one which meets your needs, then we
would love your help - pull requests to list them here are welcome!

## Creating Applications

In addition to a switch, each instance of an application must generate
its own unique, private RSA keypair. This keypair is used to used to
identify and each application instance when communicating with other
applications.

An application must also bundle and optionally provide a mechanism to
retrieve a list of "seeds" - well-known and accessible DHT members.
This will be used to bootstrap and connect into the DHT. The entries in
this list will consist minimally of the public key, IP address and port
of each seed.

## Hashnames
Every instance of an application has a unique public id that is called
it's "hashname". Any application instance can use the DHT to find
others by knowing their hashname. By default there is a single global
DHT, but Telehash also supports applications creating their own private
DHTs if needed.

The hashname which every endpoint within Telehash is identified is a
64-character hex string, which is formed by the SHA-256 digest of the
DER binary RSA public key. This key has a requirement of being a
minimum of 2048 bits.

An example of how to create a hashname using Node.js:

``` js
var key = new
    Buffer("MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEArq38dvKzL5W2Qqp
    gQN7Ao5OWFhX04aIrYZH5sLjOzyI0gWZ6ZzpQifRk+L1yNU3nkotKfeQF5zzZvo4F7Y
    C4fZgkCN2TnvBihKj25CHVDKLOtV01LvPvEEX+oHQyUzT90FT5UUIdOqTXHY4yT+nox
    bQOAMSOsJHulpIMeDR+hPWYuZ5eZWfRimu0vEE1ujAeKGUk5avKtNtJIRDXBRRem/CB
    PG5QRe+54w94Xwp1l3VQdJaD+qRKBEG/hhSVqUHfRqVccNR4AV+q37XGDAupGc7YUJ6
    qnj7TnapQGrSno13IG+2PIhL3gB1lMWEGE/hwN1dxuUAXXsIgPU3KwIDAQAB",
    "base64");
var hashname =
    require("crypto").createHash("sha256").update(key).digest('hex');
```

Since the DHT is based on Kademlia this makes a [Sybil
attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) more difficult, but
not impossible.  Additional techniques which are described later are
used to further combat this attack when deciding which hashnames to
maintain in the bucket list.

## Packets

Packets are a foundational piece of the protocol. A packet uses JSON as
a core extensible and widely supported data format, but also must
support binary data transfer for efficiency.

Every packet must begin with two bytes which form a network byte-order
short unsigned integer. This integer represents the length in bytes of
the UTF-8 encoded JSON object which follows it. The JSON portion of the
packet is required, so the length must be at least 2 (the JSON document
`{}`), and less than the length of the raw UDP message minus the two 
bytes for length value.

Any remaining bytes on the packet are considered raw binary and
referenced as the 'BODY' when used in definitions below.

The format is thus:

    <length><JSON>[BODY]

An example of how to decode a packet, written in Node.js:

``` js
dgram.createSocket("udp4", function(msg){
    var length = msg.readUInt16BE(0);
    var js = JSON.parse(msg.toString("utf8", 2, length + 2));
    var body = msg.slice(length + 2);
});
```

### JSON

The JSON section of a packet often acts as a header of a binary payload.
The fields used vary depending on the context and are specified below,
but all top-level packets contain a `type` field with a string value.

### BODY

The optional BODY is always a raw binary of the remainder bytes between
the packet's total length and that of the JSON as indicated by LENGTH
above. Often a BODY is another full raw packet and will be decoded
identically to being read from the UDP socket, this pattern of one
packet enclosing/attaching another is how the RSA signatures and
encryption are implemented.

The BODY is also used as the raw (optionally binary) content transport
for streams and for any app-specific usage.

### Packet Processing

The Telehash specification as well as other applications may use
packets recursively, by embedding the (possibly encrypted) byte
representation of an inner packet into the BODY of an outer one. As a
result, switch implementations must be prepared to decode packets not
just from UDP messagess, but from a BODY or after decryption.

## Packet types
When a packet is being processed from a UDP message initially, it's
JSON must contain a `type` field with a string value of `open` or
`line`, each of which determine how to process the BODY of the packet:

 * [`open`](#open) - this is a request to establish a new encrypted
   session (a `line`) and contains the data to do so
 * [`line`](#line) - this is an encrypted packet for an already
   established session

Once a line is established, all packets sent thereafter within a line
will contain a [stream](#stream) as the content-transport method
between any two hashnames.

<a name="open" />
### `open` - Establishing a Line

A packet of `"type":"open"` is used to establish a temporary encrypted
session between any two hashnames, this session is called a "line". You
must know the RSA public key of the recipient in order to send an
`open` message to them.

Every open packet requires the additional JSON keys of `open`, `iv`,
and `sig`, here's an example of the JSON part of the packet:

```js
{
    "type":"open",
    "open":"ZkQklgyD91XQaih07VBUGeQmAM9tnR5qMGMavZ9TNqQMCVfTW8TxDr9y37cgB8g6r9dngWLjXuRKe+nYNAG/1ZU4XK+GiR2vUBS8VTcAMzBcUls+GIfZU6WO/zEIu4ra1I1vI8qnYY5MqS/FQ/kMXk9RyzERaD38IWZLk3DYhn8VYPnVnQX62mE5u20usMWQt99F8ITLy972nOhdx5y9RUnnSrtc1SD9xr8O0rco22NtOEWC3uAISwC9xuihT+U7OEcvSKolScFI4oSpRu+DQWl19EAuG9ACqhs5+X3qNeBRMSH8w5+ThOVHaAWKGfFs/FNMdAte3ki8rFesMtfhXQ==",
    "iv":"60aa6514ef28178f816d701b9d81a29d",
    "sig":"o6buYor8o3YXkPIDJjufn9udfWDJt5hrgnVtKtvZI2ObOPlPSqlb2AdH6QsC7CuwtboGlt6eMbE7Ep6Js2CXeksXTCSZOJ99US7TH0kZ1H1aDqxYpQlM6BADOjG6YOcW+EhniotNUBiw3r02Xt4ohSm0wXxQ97JM95ntFBRnWr1vG25d+5pJQE4LyN2TwB4uApu9zeUoTPhF7daJQOcIMn9en+XxyuBsG61oR/x29bpaoZJGnKrk2DGH1jDnI5GpxIKUbT/Pa7QOlrICUCjGDgxy2TMQ+fiip5sIflxtFUPM/BV9mh4K7/ZaekJXTFfG2FKvJFytQkWbisDVy5EbEA=="
}
```

The required values of the open packet are defined as:

   * `open` - a base64 string value that is is created by generating a
     new elliptic (ECC) public key and using RSA to encrypt it *to* the
	 recipient's RSA public key. The ECC keypair should be generated
	 using the P-256 ([nistp256/secp256r] 
	 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6239#page-4)) curve. The key
     should be in the uncompressed form, 65 bytes. The RSA encryption
     should use PKCS OAEP padding.
   * `iv` - 16 random bytes hex encoded to be used as an initialization
     vector
   * `sig` - a base64 string created using the sender's RSA public key
     to sign (SHA256 hash and PKCS1 padding) the attached
     (encrypted) binary body.

The BODY of the open packet will be a binary encrypted blob containing
another packet. The encryption is done using AES-256-CTR using the IV
value above. The AES key is formed by doing a SHA-256 hash of the ECC
public key in uncompressed form. 

Here's an example of the JSON content of this inner packet before
encryption:

```js
{
    "to":"851042800434dd49c45299c6c3fc69ab427ec49862739b6449e1fcd77b27d3a6",
    "at":1375983687346,
    "line":"8b945f90f08940c573c29352d767fee4"
}
```

The inner packet's required values are defined as:

   * `to` - which hashname this line is being created to
   * `line` - the unique id the recipient must use for sending any line
     packets, 16 random bytes hex encoded
   * `at` - an integer timestamp (milliseconds since epoch) of when it
     was sent, used to another open request is newer
   * `family` - an [optional field](#family) that can be included/set
     by the app to add a grouping or other identity

This inner packet holds the sender's RSA public key as the BODY
attachment, in binary DER format.

#### Packet Generation

A rough order of the steps needed create a new open packet are:

  1. Verify you have the recipient public key. If you do not have the
     recipient's public key, you may need to trigger the recipient to
     connect to you first. This is done via a [`connect`](#connect),
     described later.
  2. Generate an IV and a line identifier from a secure random source,
     both 16 bytes
  3. Generate a new elliptic curve keypair, based on the "nistp256"
     curve
  4. SHA-256 hash the public elliptic key to form the encryption key
     for the inner packet
  5. Form the inner packet containing a current timestamp `at`, `line`
     identifier, recipient `hashname`, and `family` (if you have such a
     value). Your own RSA public key is the packet BODY.
  6. Encrypt the inner packet using the hashed public elliptic key from
     #4 and the IV you generated at #2 using AES-256-CTR with no counter
     value.
  7. Create a signature from the encrypted inner packet using your own
     RSA keypair, a SHA 256 digest, and PKCSv1.5 padding
  8. Create an `open` param, by encrypting the public elliptic curve key
     you generated (in uncompressed form) with the recipient's RSA
     public key and OAEP padding.
  9. Form the outer packet containing the `open` type, `open` param, the
     generated `iv`, and the signature from the previous step
  10. If you have also received an open packet from the recipient
      hostname, you may use it now to generate a `line` shared secret,
	  using the ECC public key they sent in their `open` packet and
	  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman

An example of the generation of an open packet in Node.js is:

 ```js
 var eccSession = new eccKey("nistp256");

 var attached = {js:{}, body:myRSAPublicKey};
 attached.js.to = recipientHashname;
 attached.js.at = Date.now();
 attached.js.line = crypto.randomBytes(20).toString("hex");
 var attachedRaw = packetEncode(attached);

 var open = {js:{type:"open"}};
 open.js.open = rsa(recipientRSAPublicKey).encrypt(eccSession.PublicKey, "PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING").toString("base64");

 var aesKey = crypto.createHash("sha256").update(eccSession.PublicKey).digest();
 var aesIV = crypto.randomBytes(16);
 var aesCipher = crypto.createCipheriv("AES-256-CTR", aesKey, aesIV);
 open.body = Buffer.concat([aesCipher.update(attachedRaw), aesCipher.final()]);
 open.js.iv = aesIV.toString("hex");
 open.js.sig = rsa(myRSAPrivateKey).hashAndSign("sha256", open.body, "PKCS1_PADDING").toString("base64");

 var openRaw = packetEncode(open);
 ```

#### Packet Processing
To process an `open` packet, the recipient will follow the following
rough order of steps:

  1. Using your private key and OAEP padding, decrypt the `open` param,
     extracting the ECC public key (in uncompressed form) of the sender
  2. Hash the ECC public key with SHA-256 to generate an AES key
  3. Decrypt the inner packet using the generated key and IV value with
     the AES-256-CTR algorithm and no counter value.
  4. Verify the `to` value of the inner packet matches your hashname
  5. Extract the RSA public key of the sender from the inner packet BODY
  6. SHA-256 hash the RSA public key to derive the sender's hashname
  7. Verify the `at` timestamp is both within a reasonable amount of
     time to account for network delays and clock skew, and is newer
     than any other 'open' requests received from the sender.
  8. Using the RSA public key of the sender, verify the signature of
     the original (encrypted) form of the inner packet
  9. If an open packet has not already been sent to this hashname, do
     so by creating one following the steps above
  10. If you have received an open packet from the recipient
      hostname, you may use it now to generate a `line` shared secret,
	  using the ECC public key they sent in their `open` packet and
	  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).

Example open packet validation logic in node (simplified):

```js
// generate these to identify the line being created for each sender
var myEccSession = new eccKey("nistp256");
var myLineId = crypto.randomBytes(20).toString("hex");

var packet = packetDecode(openRaw);

var open = rsa(myRSAPrivateKey).decrypt(packet.js.open, "base64", "PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING");
var senderEccPublicKey = new eccKey("nistp256", open);

var aesKey = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(open).digest();
var aesIV = new Buffer(packet.js.iv, "hex");
var aesDecipher = crypto.createDecipheriv("AES-256-CTR", aesKey, aesIV);
var attached = packetDecode(Buffer.concat([aesDecipher.update(packet.body), aesDecipher.final()]));

if(attached.js.to !== self.hashname) return; // must match recipients hashname

var senderRSAPublicKey = deciphered.body;
var valid = rsa(senderRSAPublicKey).hashAndVerify("sha256", packet.body, packet.js.sig, "base64", "PKCS1_PADDING");

// generate the aes session key used for all of the line encryption
var ecdheSecret = myEccSession.deriveSharedSecret(senderEccPublicKey);
var lineEncryptKey = crypto.createHash("sha256")
  .update(ecdheSecret)
  .update(new Buffer(myLineId, "hex"))
  .update(new Buffer(attached.js.line, "hex"))
  .digest();
var lineDecryptKey = crypto.createHash("sha256")
  .update(ecdheSecret)
  .update(new Buffer(attached.js.line, "hex"))
  .update(new Buffer(myLineId, "hex"))
  .digest();
```

<a name="line" />
### `line` - Packet Encryption

A packet with a `"type":"line"` is only sent/valid after an open has
been exchanged, and is required to have a `line` parameter (such as
`"line":"be22ad779a631f63336fe051d5aa2ab2"`) with the value being the
same as the one the recipient sent in its `open` packet, and a random
IV value (such as `"iv":"8b945f90f08940c573c29352d767fee4"`) used for
the AES encryption.  This ensures that no line packets can be received
without being invited in an open. Any unknown ones are just ignored.

The BODY is a binary encoded encrypted packet using AES-256-CTR with
the key that was generated for the line and the 16-byte initialization
vector decoded from the included "iv" hex value.  Once decrypted, the
recipient then processes it as a normal packet (LENGTH/JSON/BODY) from
the sending hashname.  All decrypted packets must contain a stream
value as defined below.

<a name="stream" />
### `stream` - Content Transport

All data sent between any two hashnames (inside a line packet) must
contain a `stream` parameter with a unique value (16 random bytes hex
encoded) determined by the sender for each different exchange or
channel.

A stream always begins with `type` parameter, to distinguish to the
recipient what kind of stream it is. A stream may not have any response,
or it may be long-lived with many packets exchanged using the same
"stream" identifier (depending on the type of stream). At any point a
stream can be closed by sending an `"end":true`, and if a stream is
being closed due to an error, a string message can be included as the
value of the `"err":"message"`.

The following values for `type` are used to locate and communicate with
application instances on the DHT. They are part of the core spec, and
must be implemented by all switches:

  * [`seek`](#seek) - return any pointers to other closer hashnames for
    the given `hash` (DHT), answer contains `see`
  * [`peer`](#peer) - ask the recipient to make an introduction to one
    of it's peers
  * [`connect`](#connect) - a request asking to try to open a
    connection to a given hashname (result of a `peer`)

Additional `type` values can be defined by any application as long as
they begin with an underscore like `"type":"_custom"`.  Common patterns
are also being defined as extensions, such that switches can start to
support them internally easily:

  * [`sockets`](ext_sockets.md) - raw socket proxy/transport
  * [`tickets`](ext_tickets.md) - a way to create portable data
    containers that are signed by a hashname

All UDP packets are by their very nature lossy, so streams must
be able to replicate TCP features such as reliability, retransmission,
and buffering/backpressure mechanisms. This is done by requiring a
lightweight `"seq":0` field on every packet. All seq values start at 0
and increment per packet sent. A buffer of these packets must be kept
keyed by the seq value until the receiving hashname has responded
confirming them in a `ack` and not in the `miss`. The `ack` is the
highest known `seq` value received. The `miss` is an array of integers
and must be sent along with any `ack` if in the process of receiving
packets there were any missing sequences, containing in any order the
missing sequence values up to the `ack`.  Upon receipt those missed
packets should be resent verbatim.

By default a stream should be invalidated if a sequence has been missed
three or more times, or there's more than 100 missed packets by default
(senders cannot send more than that without a confirming range). When
there's consistently missing packets, senders should limit the number
of packets beyond the confirmed range. (needs more examples/definition)

When reliability isn't required for a stream, either side can send an
`ack` of the last received `seq` value without tracking any misses,
while still following the 100-max-outstanding rule to provide for any
congestion/loss detection.

<a name="seek" />
### `"type":"seek"` - Finding Hashnames (DHT)

The core of telehash is a basic Kademlia-based DHT. The bulk of the complexity is in the rules around maintaining a mesh of lines and calculating distance explained [below](#kademlia). The `"seek":"851042800434dd49c45299c6c3fc69ab427ec49862739b6449e1fcd77b27d3a6"` value is always another hashname that the app is trying to connect to.

When one hashname wants to connect to another hashname, it finds the closest lines it knows and sends a `seek` containing the hash value to them.  They return a compact `"see":[...]` array of addresses that are closest to the hash value.  The addresses are a compound comma-delimited string containing the "hash,ip,port" (these are intentionally not JSON as the verbosity is not helpful here), for example "1700b2d3081151021b4338294c9cec4bf84a2c8bdf651ebaa976df8cff18075c,123.45.67.89,10111". 

<a name="peer" />
### `"type":"peer"` - Introductions to new hashnames

For any hashname to send an open to another it must first have it's hashname, so there is a two step process starting with a peer request. Since new hashnames are discovered only from another (in the `see` values), they are tracked as a "via" so that they can be sent a peer request when a connection is being made to a hashname they sent.

This also serves as a workaround if any NAT exists, so that the two hashnames can send a packet to each other to make sure the path between them is open, this is called "hole punching." A peer request requires a `"peer":[...]` where the value is an array of hashnames the sender is trying to reach. The recipient of the peer request must then send a connect (below) to each of the target hashnames (that it already must have an open line to).

<a name="connect" />
### `"type":"connect"` - Connect to a hashname

The connect request is an immediate result of a peer request and must also contain an `"ip":"1.2.3.4"` and `"port":5678` with the values being of the peer requestor and a BODY of their public key.

The recipient can use the given IP, port, and public key to send an open request to the target.  If a NAT is suspected to exist, the target should have already sent a packet to ensure their side has a path mapped through the NAT and the open should then make it through.

# Switch Behaviors

Besides parsing the protocol, decoding the packets and processing the different stream types, in order to fully implement telehash a switch must also internally track and respond with the correct behaviors to support both the DHT and manage the reliability of streams that require it.

<a name="kademlia" />
## [Kademlia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia)

(this area in progress...)

Every switch must have both a startup/seeding routine, and a background line maintenance process in order to properly support the Kademlia-based DHT.

The core data structure to support this within a switch is a list of "buckets", one for each bit of distance between it's own hashname and every other hashname encountered, 160 of them.  These buckets can contain a variable number of hashnames each, but it's recommended for any switch to limit the size of each bucket to a reasonable number more than 1 and less than 10 so as to not consume too much memory or network resources maintaining lines.

The seeding process involves recursively performing a [seek](#seek) for it's own hashname against the list of seeds (provided by the app).

The maintenance process involves tracking all the hashnames seen (result of any seek) and trying to ensure a line is open to the minimum number of hashnames in each bucket.

A new seek should be sent to every idle/inactive line at least once every 60 seconds if the switch believes it is behind a NAT (to maintain the NAT mapping), or once every hour if it knows it is not.  By seeking it's own hashname, any new hashnames near it will be returned to help maintain the DHT.

## Stream Congestion Control

(this area in progress...)

Reliability is optional for streams based on their type, each type must define if it requires it or not, and custom ones from the application must signal if they don't require it.

<a name="family" />
## Family Usage

The family key included in the open packet can be used to create a private/closed DHT by only responding to packets that have a valid value.  The app should always set the family value and provide a function to validate it.

It is also used to optimize the DHT for both resistance to general flooding and for search speed by creating an affinity for other hashnames with a trusted family value.  If an app predominantly only searches for and connects to hashnames created by other instances of itself, it should always send a family value that its other instances can validate.  Every switch must include the ability to maintain a preference in it's bucket list for the DHT, and if the app has a family then up to 50% of each bucket should be dedicated to any peers that have been validated.
