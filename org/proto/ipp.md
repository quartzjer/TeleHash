IP:PORT (1.2.3.4:5678)
==================

The public IP:PORT (IPP) is the primary identifier of any Switch, the SHA1 of it is its location on the DHT.

The IPP also works identically for ipv6, but a switch is either ipv4 or ipv6 since the identifiers, buckets, and see responses are all IP specific.
